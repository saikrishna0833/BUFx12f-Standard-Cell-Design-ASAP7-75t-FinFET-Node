BUFx12f Standard Cell Design — ASAP7 75t FinFET Node
This project focuses on the design, simulation, and layout verification of a BUFx12f standard cell using the ASAP7 75t FinFET technology node.  The buffer is designed to provide 12× drive strength compared to a unit inverter, optimized for performance using multi-stage buffering and FO4 methodology.
